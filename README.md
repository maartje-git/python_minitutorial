# python_minitutorial

Matthew Humphrey is giving us bite size pieces of Python, every Friday morning.
In this repository, I will save all scripts and data files I use during these tutorials.

210205 - added all scripts and data files up to now, organized week by week
From now on I will make different folders for scripts, data and output
Gradually changes all scripts, so they work with the new directory organization and therefore deleting the older directories
